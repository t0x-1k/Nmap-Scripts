# Nmap-Scripts
Bash script for running nmap


The main objective is to supply an nmap scan you like to run, or use more often without having to type out the full command.
Just open the basic_scripts.sh file, add the command at the bottom and rename however you chose.
Make file executable, use -i flag and supply an ip address.
